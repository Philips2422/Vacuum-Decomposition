♻️ Vacuum-Based Plastic Decomposition System
Decomposing plastic safely using vacuum, UV rays, and smart sensors.

Description:
This project proposes an environmentally friendly system to break down plastic and non-biodegradable waste. Using a combination of low-pressure vacuum conditions, UV radiation, and sensor-monitored Arduino modules, waste is collected, monitored, and decomposed efficiently with minimal harmful byproducts.
The Arduino-controlled module navigates autonomously using an ultrasonic sensor and monitors emissions such as methane (MQ-4) and carbon monoxide (MQ-7) during the process. Inside the vacuum chamber, the waste becomes brittle and is decomposed safely, offering a scalable, modular solution for urban waste management.

Key Features:
-Arduino-based autonomous waste collection
-Ultrasonic sensors for obstacle avoidance
-MQ-4 and MQ-7 gas sensors to monitor harmful emissions
-Vacuum chamber simulating low-pressure conditions
-UV-ray-induced plastic decomposition
-Environmentally safe and scalable design
